|**2024-08-14**|**End-to-end Semantic-centric Video-based Multimodal Affective Computing**|Ronghao Lin et.al.|[2408.07694](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07694)|null|In the pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), understanding human's affection is essential to enhance machine's cognition abilities. For achieving more sensual human-AI interaction, Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) in human-spoken videos has attracted increasing attention. However, previous methods are mainly devoted to designing multimodal fusion algorithms, suffering from two issues: semantic imbalance caused by diverse pre-processing operations and semantic mismatch raised by inconsistent affection content contained in different modalities comparing with the multimodal ground truth. Besides, the usage of manual features extractors make they fail in building end-to-end pipeline for multiple MAC downstream tasks. To address above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named SemanticMAC to compute multimodal semantic-centric affection for human-spoken videos. We firstly employ pre-trained Transformer model in multimodal data pre-processing and design Affective Perceiver module to capture unimodal affective information. Moreover, we present a semantic-centric approach to unify multimodal representation learning in three ways, including gated feature interaction, multi-task pseudo label generation, and intra-/inter-sample contrastive learning. Finally, SemanticMAC effectively learn specific- and shared-semantic representations in the guidance of semantic-centric labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpass the state-of-the-art methods on 7 public datasets in four MAC downstream tasks.|

Existing multimodal networks are designed in a multi-branch fashion that, due to the reliance on fusion strategies, exhibit deteriorated performance if one or more modalities are missing. In this work, we propose a modality invariant multimodal learning method, which is less susceptible to the impact of missing modalities. It consists of a single-branch network sharing weights across multiple modalities to learn inter-modality representations to maximize performance as well as robustness to missing modalities. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging datasets including textual-visual (UPMC Food-101, Hateful Memes, Ferramenta) and audio-visual modalities (VoxCeleb1). Our proposed method achieves superior performance when all modalities are present as well as in the case of missing modalities during training or testing compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.|
|**2024-08-14**|**Robust Semi-supervised Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation via Cross Modality Collaboration**|Xiaogen Zhon et.al.|[2408.07341](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07341)|**[link](https://github.com/med-air/cmc)**|**Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.**|
|**2024-08-14**|**Enhancing Visual Question Answering through Ranking-Based Hybrid Training and Multimodal Fusion**|Peiyuan Chen et.al.|[2408.07303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07303)|null|Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires systems to provide accurate answers to questions based on image content. Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.|
|**2024-08-13**|**Prioritizing Modalities: Flexible Importance Scheduling in Federated Multimodal Learning**|Jieming Bian et.al.|[2408.06549](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06549)|null|Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables devices to collaboratively train models without sharing their local data, ensuring user privacy and scalability. However, applying FL to real-world data presents challenges, particularly as most existing FL research focuses on unimodal data. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged to address these challenges, leveraging modality-specific encoder models to process diverse datasets. Current MFL methods often uniformly allocate computational frequencies across all modalities, which is inefficient for IoT devices with limited resources. In this paper, we propose FlexMod, a novel approach to enhance computational efficiency in MFL by adaptively allocating training resources for each modality encoder based on their importance and training requirements. We employ prototype learning to assess the quality of modality encoders, use Shapley values to quantify the importance of each modality, and adopt the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method from deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of training resources. Our method prioritizes critical modalities, optimizing model performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of MFL models.|
|**2024-08-12**|**Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning for Polyp Re-Identification**|Suncheng Xiang et.al.|[2408.05914](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05914)|null|Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras and plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized multimodal representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.|
|**2024-08-11**|**Advancing Re-Ranking with Multimodal Fusion and Target-Oriented Auxiliary Tasks in E-Commerce Search**|Enqiang Xu et.al.|[2408.05751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05751)|null|In the rapidly evolving field of e-commerce, the effectiveness of search re-ranking models is crucial for enhancing user experience and driving conversion rates. Despite significant advancements in feature representation and model architecture, the integration of multimodal information remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the computation and fusion of textual and visual information in the context of re-ranking. We propose \textbf{A}dvancing \textbf{R}e-Ranking with \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal Fusion and \textbf{T}arget-Oriented Auxiliary Tasks (ARMMT), which integrates an attention-based multimodal fusion technique and an auxiliary ranking-aligned task to enhance item representation and improve targeting capabilities. This method not only enriches the understanding of product attributes but also enables more precise and personalized recommendations. Experimental evaluations on JD.com's search platform demonstrate that ARMMT achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal information integration, evidenced by a 0.22\% increase in the Conversion Rate (CVR), significantly contributing to Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). This pioneering approach has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce re-ranking, leading to elevated user satisfaction and business growth.|
|**2024-08-09**|**Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing**|Jiarui Xie et.al.|[2408.05307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307)|null|Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect laser additive manufacturing (LAM) process anomalies and defects. Multimodal fusion can improve in-situ monitoring performance by acquiring and integrating data from multiple modalities, including visual and audio data. However, multimodal fusion employs multiple sensors of different types, which leads to higher hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper proposes a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology that transfers knowledge from a source to a target modality for LAM in-situ monitoring. CMKT enhances the usefulness of the features extracted from the target modality during the training phase and removes the sensors of the source modality during the prediction phase. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. Semantic alignment establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It utilizes a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of the same classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defective classes) and a separation loss to separate the distributions of different classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free classes). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving the features of one modality from the other modality using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning. The proposed CMKT methods were implemented and compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion in an LAM in-situ anomaly detection case study. The semantic alignment method achieves a 98.4% accuracy while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the accuracy of multimodal fusion (98.2%).|
|**2024-08-08**|**MU-MAE: Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning**|Rex Liu et.al.|[2408.04243](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04243)|null|With the exponential growth of multimedia data, leveraging multimodal sensors presents a promising approach for improving accuracy in human activity recognition. Nevertheless, accurately identifying these activities using both video data and wearable sensor data presents challenges due to the labor-intensive data annotation, and reliance on external pretrained models or additional data. To address these challenges, we introduce Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning (Mu-MAE). Mu-MAE integrates a multimodal masked autoencoder with a synchronized masking strategy tailored for wearable sensors. This masking strategy compels the networks to capture more meaningful spatiotemporal features, which enables effective self-supervised pretraining without the need for external data. Furthermore, Mu-MAE leverages the representation extracted from multimodal masked autoencoders as prior information input to a cross-attention multimodal fusion layer. This fusion layer emphasizes spatiotemporal features requiring attention across different modalities while highlighting differences from other classes, aiding in the classification of various classes in metric-based one-shot learning. Comprehensive evaluations on MMAct one-shot classification show that Mu-MAE outperforms all the evaluated approaches, achieving up to an 80.17% accuracy for five-way one-shot multimodal classification, without the use of additional data.|
|**2024-08-08**|**M2EF-NNs: Multimodal Multi-instance Evidence Fusion Neural Networks for Cancer Survival Prediction**|Hui Luo et.al.|[2408.04170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04170)|null|Accurate cancer survival prediction is crucial for assisting clinical doctors in formulating treatment plans. Multimodal data, including histopathological images and genomic data, offer complementary and comprehensive information that can greatly enhance the accuracy of this task. However, the current methods, despite yielding promising results, suffer from two notable limitations: they do not effectively utilize global context and disregard modal uncertainty. In this study, we put forward a neural network model called M2EF-NNs, which leverages multimodal and multi-instance evidence fusion techniques for accurate cancer survival prediction. Specifically, to capture global information in the images, we use a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model to obtain patch feature embeddings of histopathological images. Then, we introduce a multimodal attention module that uses genomic embeddings as queries and learns the co-attention mapping between genomic and histopathological images to achieve an early interaction fusion of multimodal information and better capture their correlations. Subsequently, we are the first to apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to cancer survival prediction. We parameterize the distribution of class probabilities using the processed multimodal features and introduce subjective logic to estimate the uncertainty associated with different modalities. By combining with the Dempster-Shafer theory, we can dynamically adjust the weights of class probabilities after multimodal fusion to achieve trusted survival prediction. Finally, Experimental validation on the TCGA datasets confirms the significant improvements achieved by our proposed method in cancer survival prediction and enhances the reliability of the model.|

A Dynamic Multi-agent Framework for Competitive Debate**|Yiqun Zhang et.al.|[2408.04472](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04472)|**[link](https://github.com/zhangyiqun018/agent-for-debate)**|**Competitive debate is a comprehensive and complex computational argumentation task. Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter hallucinations and lack competitiveness in this task. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent for Debate (Agent4Debate), a dynamic, multi-agent framework based on LLMs designed to enhance their capabilities in competitive debate. Drawing inspiration from human behavior in debate preparation and execution, Agent4Debate employs a collaborative architecture where four specialized agents (Searcher, Analyzer, Writer, and Reviewer) dynamically interact and cooperate. These agents work throughout the debate process, covering multiple stages from initial research and argument formulation to rebuttal and summary. To comprehensively evaluate framework performance, we construct the Chinese Debate Arena, comprising 66 carefully selected Chinese debate motions. We recruite ten experienced human debaters and collect records of 200 debates involving Agent4Debate, baseline models, and humans. The evaluation employs the Debatrix automatic scoring system and professional human reviewers based on the established Debatrix-Elo and Human-Elo ranking. Experimental results indicate that the state-of-the-art Agent4Debate exhibits capabilities comparable to those of humans. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the agent structure.**|
|**2024-08-07**|**A Logical Fallacy-Informed Framework for Argument Generation**|Luca Mouchel et.al.|[2408.03618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03618)|null|Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. An important factor contributing to LLMs' suboptimal performance in generating coherent arguments is their oversight of logical fallacies. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy categories. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as prior preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation.|

|**2024-07-06**|**Advancing Algorithmic Approaches to Probabilistic Argumentation under the Constellation Approach**|Andrei Popescu et.al.|[2407.05058](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05058)|null|Reasoning with defeasible and conflicting knowledge in an argumentative form is a key research field in computational argumentation. Reasoning under various forms of uncertainty is both a key feature and a challenging barrier for automated argumentative reasoning. It was shown that argumentative reasoning using probabilities faces in general high computational complexity, in particular for the so-called constellation approach. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic approach to overcome this obstacle. We refine existing complexity results and show that two main reasoning tasks, that of computing the probability of a given set being an extension and an argument being acceptable, diverge in their complexity: the former is #P-complete and the latter is #-dot-NP-complete when considering their underlying counting problems. We present an algorithm for the complex task of computing the probability of a set of arguments being a complete extension by using dynamic programming operating on tree-decompositions. An experimental evaluation shows promise of our approach.|

Among others, the most successful approaches have been based on (i) the cross-lingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models (model-transfer), (ii) data translation and label projection (data-transfer) and (iii), prompt-based learning by reusing the mask objective to exploit the few-shot capabilities of pre-trained language models (few-shot). Previous work seems to conclude that model-transfer outperforms data-transfer methods and that few-shot techniques based on prompting are superior to updating the model's weights via fine-tuning. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that, for Argument Mining, a sequence labelling task which requires the detection of long and complex discourse structures, previous insights on cross-lingual transfer or few-shot learning do not apply. Contrary to previous work, we show that for Argument Mining data transfer obtains better results than model-transfer and that fine-tuning outperforms few-shot methods. Regarding the former, the domain of the dataset used for data-transfer seems to be a deciding factor, while, for few-shot, the type of task (length and complexity of the sequence spans) and sampling method prove to be crucial.**|
|**2024-06-28**|**Unlocking Varied Perspectives: A Persona-Based Multi-Agent Framework with Debate-Driven Text Planning for Argument Generation**|Zhe Hu et.al.|[2406.19643](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19643)|null|Writing persuasive arguments is a challenging task for both humans and machines. It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate surface tokens autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing. The results show that our framework can generate more diverse and persuasive arguments through both automatic and human evaluations.|
